This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Swift's async/await feature: incomplete error handling.  The `fetchData` function uses async/await, correctly throwing errors. However, the `Task` block only prints the error to the console, which is inadequate for robust error handling in production code.  The solution shows how to improve this using a `do-catch` block with more informative error handling.
